00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production and thereby the relations

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.000
of production and with them the whole relations of society.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.000
Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form was on the contrary the

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.000
first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:37.100
Constant revolutionising of production uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.000
the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.000
All fixed fast-frozen relations with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions are

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.000
swept away all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:02.000
All that is solid melts into air all that is holy is profaned and man

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.000
is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.000
his relations with his kind.
