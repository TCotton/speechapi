00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production and thereby the relations

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.600
of production and with them the whole relations of society.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.900
Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form was on the contrary the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.000
first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.300
Constant revolutionising of production uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.000
the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.300
All fixed fast-frozen relations with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions are

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.800
swept away all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.100
All that is solid melts into air all that is holy is profaned and man

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.400
is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.700
his relations with his kind.
